Hello!
At this point, I do not have links to any personal projects. I am currently working on Koch triangles, which are 
a series of equilateral triangles which start with a single (large) triangle, and then on the next round another 
set of triangles is generated at the midpoints of the sides of the first triangle, et cetera. 

I started coding this in C, but its lack of a class structure for the triangles hampers the coding. I am currently
setting this up in C++.

Other languages I have some familiarity with are Python and Java. My first language was FORTRAN, and yes, it was
learned on punch cards. 🧮
